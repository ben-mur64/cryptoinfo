# Microblogging Website

This serves as my creative project number two for CS 260 at BYU. It's a simple single-page site that lets the user pull in information about different cryptocurrencies.

It was built on raw Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and it calls the api at [Coinlore](https://www.coinlore.com/cryptocurrency-data-api).
